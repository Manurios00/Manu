imported from other miners developped by lucas Jones, djm34, Wolf0, pooler,
Jeff garzik, ig0tik3d, elmad, palmd, and Optiminer, with additional
optimizations by Jay D Dee.

Requirements
------------

1. A x86_64 architecture CPU with a minimum of SSE2 support. This includes
Intel Core2 and newer and AMD equivalents. In order to take advantage of AES_NI
optimizations a CPU with AES_NI is required. This includes Intel Westbridge
and newer and AMD equivalents. Further optimizations are available on some
algoritms for CPUs with AVX and AVX2, Sandybridge and Haswell respectively.

Older CPUs are supported by cpuminer-multi by TPruvot but at reduced
performance.

2. 64 bit Linux OS. Ubuntu and Fedora based distributions, including Mint and
Centos are known to work and have all dependencies in their repositories.
Others may work but may require more effort.
64 bit Windows OS is supported with mingw_w64 and msys or pre-built binaries.

3. Stratum pool, cpuminer-opt only supports stratum minning. Some algos
may work wallet mining but there are no guarantees.

Errata
------

cpuminer-opt does not work mining Decred algo at Nicehash and produces
only "invalid extranonce2 size" rejects.

Benchmark testing does not work for x11evo.
